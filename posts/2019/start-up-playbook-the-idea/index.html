It's a great website if anyone wants to start their company in the future.
Here is the summery of this playbook and some of my thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea</h3>
<p>This is the most important part of starting a startup. A startup needs to focus on what it is solving and who needs this product. It's not like you can think of a idea overnight, I think sometimes a good idea came from stupid, shitty topic. For instance, I really like a comedy called &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo;. The story focus on a group of people that are building, iterating a product and the shit things they confront. Richard, one of the protagonists figured out &ldquo;Middle Out Algorithm&rdquo; when the team are discussing how much time they will need to jerk off all of the people in TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll start with a simple idea that people need to solve. My colleague, which is a account manager, she switches messeging apps eveyday to communicate with different customers. An All-In-One messege app can help her work more efficiently. After some research, I found some desktop apps that have already been done by people. It's impossible to build an All-In-One mobile app because it means that Facebook, Line, Skype, WeChat need to release API for their messeging service.</p>
<p>The playbook recommended that don't try to create a startup if you don't have a good idea. From their experiences, all of the companies that start off with no ideas failed at the end. Here are the advices from the playbook:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn about a lot of different things.</li>
<li>Practice noticing problems, things that seem inefficient, and major technological shifts.</li>
<li>Work on projects you find interesting.</li>
<li>Go out of your way to hang around smart, interesting people.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-great-team">A Great Team</h3>
<p>I think there are two factors to build a great team. Firstly, the characteristics of the founder/co-founder. I think the ability to bound people together and passion are very important. The founder doesn't need to be the best coder or the smartest guy, but he/she needs to have the passion to keep things running. I would like to call it &ldquo;Passion Driven Development&rdquo;. üòè Founders need to precise, determined and passionate to keep employees work for this company. Secondly, the employees that hired by the founder. It is crucial to find people with passion and agree with our ideas. The company culture we want decides the people who we are looking for.</p>
<p>The book also mentioned that tech startups need to have one founder who can build the product, and one founder who is good at sales and socialing with others. This can be the same person. However, I think it is best to have two different people responsible for particular job. They also have the ability to handle the other person's job when the other cofounder is not available, a person who can backup another one.</p>
<p>Another challenge for founders is the decisiveness when firing a person. It is both very hard to find a great team member and fire a member that is not suited for the team. Founders will need some strict rules that whenever a person violates one of the rules, he/she will be fired. Maybe the employee isn't suitable for other team members, this might also be the time to just let them go. ‚ùÑ</p>
<h3 id="a-great-product">A Great Product</h3>
<p>The secret for having a great company is to have a great product. Yeah, we know. üòÇ In order to create a excellent product, we need to follow these concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect User's feedbacks</li>
</ol>
<p>How the users think about the product is the number one thing for every entrepreneur. From the TV show &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo;, before they released their product, they invited a lot of people to use their compression platform. However, the people who satisfied are engineers. Monica, a CV who supports them, finds the platform hard to use. The team didn't realize that the platform is really hard for non-engineers to use.</p>
<p>A product cannot be successful if the end users don't want to use it. This playbook highly suggests that the founder or the team needs to be close to the users. Build a product that users will want to share with other people. Build a product that the team will actually use.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Iteration</li>
</ol>
<p>After collecting users&rsquo; feedbacks, we will need to quickly iterate the product. Release functions that the users really want.
The users might be willing to use it more often because the product is improving.</p>
<h3 id="great-execution">Great Execution</h3>
<p>Doing is always better than reading. Let's go!</p>
