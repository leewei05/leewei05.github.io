			<description>Finally got some time to do this. This is the first post of me learning data structures and algorithms online courses. I&amp;rsquo;ll take down my notes and put it here to share with you guys. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!
Introduction Why is data structures and algorithms so important? Why does every student major in computer science related fields needs to take this course?
The answer is because we need to practice Leetcode questions and pass interviews to get a job.</description>

<p>Finally got some time to do this.
This is the first post of me learning data structures and algorithms online courses.
I&rsquo;ll take down my notes and put it here to share with you guys. Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Why is data structures and algorithms so important?
Why does every student major in computer science related fields needs to take this course?</p>

<p><del>The answer is because we need to practice Leetcode questions and pass interviews to get a job.</del></p>

<p>Sadly, yes but also no. That is not the main purpose why developers should learn data structures
and algorithms. The simplest answer is to let our code run faster. ðŸ˜„</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-learning-data-structures-and-algorithms">Benefits of learning Data structures and Algorithms</h2>

<p>Assume that we all want our code to run faster. We can do that by avoiding nested loops and making quicker calculations.
However, sometimes the bottleneck is not the alogrithm we use, it&rsquo;s the data structure we use.
In other words, algorithm will boost up by choosing a proper data structure.</p>

<p>For instance, Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm(Shortest Path First algorithm) is
an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes.</p>

<p>Without a proper data structure, the running time will be O(N^2), N stands for the total number of nodes. If we use a priority queue approach, we can minimize time complexity to O(N*LogN). Noice!</p>

<h2 id="data-structures-and-abstract-data-type">Data structures and Abstract data type</h2>

<p>After knowing the importance of data structures, let&rsquo;s dive into some basic concept of data structures and abstract data type.
Let&rsquo;s talk about abstract data type(ADT) first.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-data-type">Abstract data type</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type">Abstract data type</a> is a logical description of a certain data type.
ADT implies the basic behaviors of a data structure, it does not specify concrete implementation.</p>

<p>I know. It&rsquo;s confusing. ðŸ˜“</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">Stack</a> is an abstract data type which is a last-in-first-out structure and it can be defined by three methods. <code>Push</code> inserts a data item into the stack, <code>Pop</code> removes a data item from it and <code>Peek(or top)</code> can return the data item on top of the stack without removing it.</p>

<p>So basically, abstract data type defines behaviors from the view of a user. A user can execute push, pop or peek method in a stack data type.</p>

<h3 id="data-structures">Data structures</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">Data structures</a> is the concrete implementation and the physical form of a certain data type. Data structure is aim to make access and modification more efficiently.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">Array</a> is a data structure which is a collection of many elements.
Time complexity of indexing a data item in an array is O(1).</p>

<p>Data structure is the actual implementation of a data type and is from the view of a implementer.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, we can know that abstract data type and data structures are not independent from each other.
An abstract data type is like a specification and every abstract data type has an underlying data structure that is going to implement
the behaviors that are defined by the abstract data type.</p>
