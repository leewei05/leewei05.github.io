    <description><![CDATA[Time flies! It&rsquo;s already been two and a half years since I joined my first company. I remembered the time when a boy was interviewed in Customer Engineer, a new graduate who was participating his first interview of his life. He got lucky and entered the world of Cloud.
This post is a summary of the skills and mindset that I learned. First, let me quickly describe what I do in my daily routine.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In this post, we are going to set up a GitLab server on GCP. We need a git repository for our CI/CD pipeline. You might ask, there is a native GCP service called, Cloud Source Repository, why don&rsquo;t we just use that. Of course we can use that, but Source Repository lacks a lot of features like merge request, UI for code reviewing etc. In addition, we can learn how to set up our own GitLab Server and configure its domain and SSL, how cool is that.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[On the previous post, we have already build our Docker image and succefully run it on our local computer. Right now, we are going to learn some basic knowledge of Google Kubernetes Engine and how to deploy our service to it.
Kubernetes Kubernetes(k8s) is an open source system for users to manage their containerized applications.
Why do we need Kubernetes? Kubernetes is a system that makes sure our containers are running as we expected.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In this part, we will build a RESTful API server and wrap it in Docker. After that, we&rsquo;ll deploy it on GKE and start build our CI/CD pipeline for the whole project.
Import Environment Variables Using environment variables to define our database parameters is a better way. There are several reasons that we should not hard code our parameters:
Security
I have seen a lot of cases that people upload their credentials or their database information to Github.]]></description>

Confusing, right? The first time I heard of this principle, I thought it was about the organization of directories. ðŸ˜†
Example 1: without DIP Let&rsquo;s say we have an application that has the following structure:]]></description>
