I remembered the time when a kid interviewed in Customer Engineer, a new graduate who was
participating his first interview of his life. He got lucky and entered the world of Cloud.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of the skills and mindset that I learned. First, let me quickly describe what I do in my daily routine. As a Google Cloud Customer Engineer, my mission is to solve customers&rsquo; issues on Google Cloud Platform. In addition, I also work with the sales team to provide better customer service and satisfy our customers. Work with marketing team to provide technical content to attract potential users. Besides all this, I&rsquo;ve also developed some internal systems and generated Data Studio reports to optimize our operation team.</p>
<h2 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know OSI model?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What is the layer of Transport Layer?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How do you find a process in Linux System?&rsquo;
&lsquo;How do you kill a process in Linux?&rsquo;. These are some of the questions that I faced when I was interviewing this position.
Surprisingly, I don&rsquo;t know the answers to all of the above questions. 😂 I don&rsquo;t know how I got the job. Probably I said that my English is excellent? Maybe? 😂</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not focus on the details of how I passed the interview, lol. I just want to point out that I&rsquo;m like a piece of paper in the beginning.</p>
<p>I learned the basics of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Linux operations</li>
<li>Linux Network tools and troubleshooting
<ul>
<li>tools like: ping, dig, nslookup, curl, mtr, traceroute, netstat, nc etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OSI model
<ul>
<li>HTTP,HTTP(S), TCP/UDP, IPv4</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Networking Concepts
<ul>
<li>DNS, CDN, proxies, load balancers, VPN, NAT</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SQL related systems and concepts
<ul>
<li>MySQL, BigQuery(OLAP)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cloud Native Concepts
<ul>
<li>SDN, Differences between on-premise and cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
<li>Go(programming language)</li>
</ul>
<p>Very lucky to have colleagues that are willing to share, even it is a simple problem.
I am always surprised by some of our senior architects, they seems to know everything. 😱
You can see from their expressions, those are years of experience and dedication to work.
They can also answer your question and extend it with other knowledge. Greatful to have them.</p>
<p>One small trick of learning, always take off your headphones and carefully listen to technical discussions. 😛 How&rsquo;s that? By eavesdropping their conversation, we can learn from how experienced people solve an issue. They can always convince each others with concrete evidences and statement. After that, they will propose possible solutions for typical issue and execute it immediately. It&rsquo;s like watching an episode of HOUSE M.D., engineering version!</p>
<p>To sums up, I&rsquo;ve learned basic skills to be an entry-level IT engineer. I think the most important thing is always be learning, because there are new tech stacks, concepts, programming languages being released every year, need to keep up the pace if we want to be competitive in the industry. 👊</p>
<h2 id="communicating-skills">Communicating Skills</h2>
<p>As a customer engineer, I need to face customers everyday. Here are some tips and experience that I can share with you.</p>
<h3 id="dont-take-things-personally">Don&rsquo;t take things personally</h3>
<p>😌 Customers are people, some will have emotions, maybe their boss just shout to their faces, maybe they are just having a bad day. Just relax and focus on the problem itself. Meditation is a good method to face all kinds of people in a peaceful way. 🙂</p>
<h3 id="guide-clients-to-their-real-issue">Guide clients to their real issue</h3>
<p>What do I mean by that? Some users are new to Google Cloud or new to managing any kinds of servers. 😂 Their first question might not be the real issue they are facing. For instance, one might send an email saying &ldquo;Help! I cannot SSH login to my GCP instance.&rdquo; What will you do? For me, I will throw out many questions for them to answer. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did this issue start occurring?</li>
<li>Can you check your PC&rsquo;s networking connections?</li>
<li>Do you have enough permissions to SSH to that machine?</li>
</ul>
<p>By throwing out these questions, they can check for themselves one-by-one and we can narrow down this issue.</p>
<h3 id="be-externally-consistent">Be externally consistent</h3>
<p>Always sync with your teammates before replying anything to the customer, especially a money issue.</p>
<h2 id="cross-team-teamwork">Cross-team Teamwork</h2>
<p>Apart from support customers, I&rsquo;ve also supported with other function teams.</p>
<p>I worked with sales team to provide technical reports; Providing technical content and on-site support for marketing team. It&rsquo;s a great chance to know how other teams operate and some of their domain knowledge.</p>
<p>Learning how to think like a sales or marketing is interesting. For instance, from a technical view, we might want to tell customer some fact about their system or plan that will not use our services. However, if you were a sales manager, you might keep these to yourselves, because we want to sell our product or services to our clients. We can think of different solutions and words to sell. I guess this is the art of conversation.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve</h2>
<h3 id="technical-skills-1">Technical Skills</h3>
<p>Since my first job is a customer-oriented position, I have confronted wide range of technical knowledge, from networking, OS, database, web servers to storage etc. It might sound awesome, but actually I didn&rsquo;t expertise in all of them. I want to have thorough hands on with these items. To start with, Operating System and Databases are my first priority. Along with the items I mentioned above, I will consider follow this <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">DevOps road map</a>. Hope I can be an engineer that is experienced enough to mentor other young fellows in the future. 😂</p>
<h3 id="communicating-skills-1">Communicating Skills</h3>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m impressed by our senior engineers is their presentation skills. In addition to their excellent technical knowledge, they are proficient in expressing their ideas. Having others to understand what you are trying to say is something important. I hope I can deliver a great and detailed session in the future. 😎</p>
<p>Second, English speaking skill is essential, because I&rsquo;ve always dreamed to work abroad one day. Compare to Mandarin, English is easy to learn though. 😅 Just need to practice oral presentation more often. 🤨</p>
<h3 id="people-connections">People Connections</h3>
<p>There is a saying in Taiwan, <code>在家靠父母，出外靠朋友</code>. It is roughly translate as the following: <code>At home we depend on our parents; Abroad, we need the help of our friends</code>. Some of the tech companies prefer people that are referred by their employees. In order to borden my connections to people, I will try to participate in tech meetups and conference(I&rsquo;m lazy, lol).</p>
<p>Always be learning!</p>
