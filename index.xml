    <description><![CDATA[In this post, we are going to set up a GitLab server on GCP. We need a git repository for our CI/CD pipeline. You might ask, there is a native GCP service called, Cloud Source Repository, why don&rsquo;t we just use that. Of course we can use that, but Source Repository lacks a lot of features like merge request, UI for code reviewing etc. In addition, we can learn how to set up our own GitLab Server and configure its domain and SSL, how cool is that.]]></description>

Kubernetes Kubernetes(k8s) is an open source system for users to manage their containerized applications.
Why do we need Kubernetes? Kubernetes is a system that makes sure our containers are running as we expected.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In this part, we will build a RESTful API server and wrap it in Docker. After that, we&rsquo;ll deploy it on GKE and start build our CI/CD pipeline for the whole project.
Import Environment Variables Using environment variables to define our database parameters is a better way. There are several reasons that we should not hard code our parameters:
Security
I have seen a lot of cases that people upload their credentials or their database information to Github.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hash Tables A hash table is an abstract data type that implements arbitrary array that maps keys to values.
 Space complexity: O(N) Operation complexity: Average is O(1), worst case is O(N).  Hash Function A hash function is how to map a large key space into a smaller domain. Need to consider the trade-off between fast execution vs. collision rate.
The fastest hash function is with a constant key, it will always return the same index.]]></description>
