      <description>RPC(Remote Procedure Call) What is RPC? RPC is a network protocol that can call a remote system process like a local system.
 Client-Server model Procedure call is also known as function call or subrountine call RPC can be implemented throughout HTTP to TCP layers  How does RPC work?  A Client starts a client stub process Client stub marshels parameters and sends to local RPC runtime RPC runtime sends to remote RPC runtime Server side will handle the function call and return the message to client RPC runtime Client stub unmarshels the return message and returns to the caller   A stub is a piece of code that converts parameters passed between client and server during a remote procedure call.</description>

This post is a summary of the skills and mindset that I learned. First, let me quickly describe what I do in my daily routine.</description>

      <description>I accidently knew the concept of Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP) when I was developing a project. Its definition:
High level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
Confusing, right? The first time I heard of this principle, I thought it was about the organization of directories. :laughing:
Example 1: without DIP Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have an application that has the following structure:</description>
