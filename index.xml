    <description><![CDATA[In this post, we are going to set up a GitLab server on GCP. We need a git repository for our CI/CD pipeline. You might ask, there is a native GCP service called, Cloud Source Repository, why don't we just use that. Of course we can use that, but Source Repository lacks a lot of features like merge request, UI for code reviewing etc. In addition, we can learn how to set up our own GitLab Server and configure its domain and SSL, how cool is that.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[On the previous post, we have already build our Docker image and succefully run it on our local computer. Right now, we are going to learn some basic knowledge of Google Kubernetes Engine and how to deploy our service to it.
Kubernetes Kubernetes(k8s) is an open source system for users to manage their containerized applications.
Why do we need Kubernetes? Kubernetes is a system that makes sure our containers are running as we expected.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In this part, we will build a RESTful API server and wrap it in Docker. After that, we'll deploy it on GKE and start build our CI/CD pipeline for the whole project.
Import Environment Variables Using environment variables to define our database parameters is a better way. There are several reasons that we should not hard code our parameters:
Security
I have seen a lot of cases that people upload their credentials or their database information to Github.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hash Tables A hash table is an abstract data type that implements arbitrary array that maps keys to values.
 Space complexity: O(N) Operation complexity: Average is O(1), worst case is O(N).  Hash Function A hash function is how to map a large key space into a smaller domain. Need to consider the trade-off between fast execution vs. collision rate.
The fastest hash function is with a constant key, it will always return the same index.]]></description>

PostgreSQL Schema Basics What is the definition of Schema in PostgreSQL Before we begin to create and set up the objects in PostgreSQL, we might need to understand the basic concept of schema in PostgreSQL. This article detailed describe the definition of Schema in PostgreSQL.
In a broader view of RDBMS, Schema is generally refered as the definition of tables, columns and other objects that constitute the database.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Andy(lecturer) said that in the early 2000s, Google is making tons of money. And one of the reason Google is expanding and scaling so fast is because they are using HBase, which is called &ldquo;BigTable&rdquo; on GCP. Google is absolutely good at large scale database systems, like Spanner, BigQuery etc. A lot of companies are trying to copy the tech stack of Google. Nevertheless, not all the companies that uses Google Cloud Platform are enterprise level companies, most of them don't have the resource like Google to develop applications using large scale databases.]]></description>

Storage  Volatile Devices: it needs power to keep its data persistent. Non-Volatile Devices: does not need continous power for device to retain its data.  Non-Volatile Memory: a storage device that is almost as fast as DRAM but with the persistence of a disk.
Disk-Oriented DBMS The data in the database files is organized into pages, and the first page is the directory page.]]></description>
